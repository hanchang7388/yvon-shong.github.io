        xml/xml.css --- in fact, we have complete the css to highlight the xml code long long ago.[HERE](http://yvon-shong.gityhub.io/xml.html)
        
## Problem:

		- my xsd and dtd are on the github.com. how can I refer them in xml?
		- I will transfer this web to https://coding.net/u/yvonshong/p/xml_course/git to check the dtd and schema.
        - in order to modufy the web of next.html to show our plan to sync this README.md, we will use the Pandoc to try to transfer the markdown file to html file.
        - iframe is hard to be adaptive and to modularize. and there are some errors of link jumping. nestification and modularization are hard by html.
		- Git plus OneDrive are convenient for two computer which are used by the only one person.
		- the editor for web like sublime text, vs code. I find the vs code integrate the Git.
