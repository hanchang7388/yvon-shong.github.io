##Update log
Mar 3rd: 

		the_module_of_movies.jpg --- the design of the structure of our XML
      
    	the_module_of_movies.xml
Mar 7th:

		movies.dtd --- the document type definition of movies.

		the_module_of_movies.xml --- reconstruct the xml, add element:score and add attribute:sex of element:star

Mar 8th：

		correct some error of the quotation marks in ddt and xml.
Mar 9th:
	
		movies.xsd --- the schema of the xml.
		the_module_of_movies.xml --- refresh the referrence definition of the schema.

		the_module_of_movies.xml --- reconstruct the xml, add element:score and add attribute:sex of element:star


##Problem:

		- my xsd and dtd are on the github.com. how can I refer them in xml?
		- I will transfer this web to https://coding.net/u/yvonshong/p/xml_course/git to check the dtd and schema.
